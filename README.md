# 🛡 Security Log Analysis & Threat Hunting using SIEM 🔍

## **📌 Project Overview**
This project demonstrates my skills as an **aspiring Security Analyst** by investigating a cybersecurity incident using **Splunk, SIEM tools, and log analysis techniques**. The objective was to detect and analyze potential threats within security logs and propose mitigation strategies.

## **📂 Project Details**
- **Platform Used:** TryHackMe
- **Key Tools:** Splunk, SIEM, Windows Event Logs, Threat Intelligence
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Log analysis for suspicious activity
  - Threat hunting using real-world attack scenarios
  - Incident response and mitigation strategies

## **🔬 Investigation & Findings**
### **1️⃣ Threat Detection**
- Identified multiple failed login attempts from **suspicious IPs** 🚨
- Tracked a **brute-force attack** followed by privilege escalation 🔑
- Discovered **anomalous activities** using Splunk & SIEM queries 📊

### **2️⃣ Incident Analysis**
- Used **Windows Event Logs** to trace attacker movements 🕵️
- Cross-referenced **threat intelligence databases** to validate IP addresses 🌍
- Detected unauthorized access leading to **data exfiltration attempts** 🛑

### **3️⃣ Security Recommendations**
✅ **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** to prevent brute-force attacks.  
✅ **Implement firewall rules** to block suspicious IPs.  
✅ **Monitor logs regularly** with SIEM for early threat detection.  
✅ **Conduct security awareness training** for employees.
